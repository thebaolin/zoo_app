It is capable of gliding flight using a skin membrane, the patagium, stretched between front and hind legs. It is found in mainland Southeast and South Asia, and southern and central China.

                    <h2>Pink Fairy Armadillo</h2>
                    <p>The pink fairy armadillo is the smallest species of armadillo. Pink fairy armadillos have small eyes, silky yellowish white fur, and flexible dorsal shells that are attached to their bodies solely by thin dorsal membranes. 
                         has a unique ability to bury itself in a matter of seconds, using its specialized claws to dig into sandy or loamy soils. This behavior helps protect the armadillo from predators and extreme temperatures, as well as conserve moisture in its arid habitat.

                    <p>The blobfish is jelly-like and inflates to float around, it eats by waiting for dead organisms to drift down. It has been adopted as the mascot of the UAPS, or Ugly Animal Preservation Society (Yes, it's a real thing!).
                        Blobfish have experienced a major threat to their populations in recent years. Though not much information is known about the species, it is well known that due to being frequent bycatch (unintentionally caught fish) in fishing nets, they could all be declared endangered soon.
